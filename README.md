Title: Ensemble Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Rule Conversion and Feature Selection Approaches with Multiple Classifiers.
Project Objectives:

Data Exploration and Pre-processing: Our initial step involves a thorough exploration and pre-processing of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its intricacies.

Rule Generation: Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, we extract meaningful rules from the dataset, shedding light on underlying patterns and relationships.

Feature Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Extra Tree Classifier, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and feature correlation analysis, help refine the dataset. The top 10 features are carefully selected for further analysis.

Refinement with SelectFromModel: We employ the SelectFromModel method to narrow down the most critical features to a mere 5, optimizing the accuracy of our analysis.

Rule Conversion: Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm once again, we convert the refined features into actionable rules, empowering our diagnosis process.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Our rule-generated insights are put to the test against an array of machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Booster, Ada Booster, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Extra Tree, and Logistic Regression.
